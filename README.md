# Description
Goal was to identify cell types in Drosophila larval hemocytes (blood cells) from 10X single cell RNA-sequencing using Seurat

# List of scripts

singlecell_dmel_hemocytes.R - Single cell analysis

DoHeatmap2.R - Modified Seurat v3 DoHeatmap function for plotting

compare_datasets.R - Comparing three Drosophilia single cell hemocyte datasets

# Overview of Seurat clustering pipeline
